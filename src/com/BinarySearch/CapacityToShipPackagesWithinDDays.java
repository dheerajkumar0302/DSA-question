package com.BinarySearch;
//A conveyor belt has packages that must be shipped from one port to another within days days.
//
//The ith package on the conveyor belt has a weight of weights[i].
// Each day, we load the ship with packages on the conveyor belt (in the order given by weights).
// We may not load more weight than the maximum weight capacity of the ship.
//
//Return the least weight capacity of the ship that will result in all the packages on the conveyor belt being shipped within days days.
//
//
//
//Example 1:
//
//Input: weights = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], days = 5
//Output: 15
//Explanation: A ship capacity of 15 is the minimum to ship all the packages in 5 days like this:
//1st day: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
//2nd day: 6, 7
//3rd day: 8
//4th day: 9
//5th day: 10
//
//Note that the cargo must be shipped in the order given, so using a ship of capacity 14 and
// splitting the packages into parts like (2, 3, 4, 5), (1, 6, 7), (8), (9), (10) is not allowed.
